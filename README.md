# Motion blur image generation with Pix2Pix

This repository shows how to create a model that uses the PIX2PIX algorithm to generate motion blur images.

I will be updating the training results, loss, training process, and more soon.

## Setup
```shell
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install IPython
pip insatll numpy
pip install -U scikit-image
pip install pillow
```

## For Training
```shell
python train.py
```

## For Generating
```shell
